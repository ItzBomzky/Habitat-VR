HABITAT VR

UrbanDev Studios is building a VR app for Andriod called Habitat VR.
This app teaches users about the different habitats in the world by taken them to the Habitats Virtually through our Experience and teaching them about the type of 
Organisms and Animals they would see in those Habitat.

when they see and Expereience what is been taught.
Our Solution makes Education better, cheaper and Knowlegde retained using Virtual Reality.
